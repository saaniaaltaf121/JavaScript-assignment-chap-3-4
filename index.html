    <h4>Exercise:3.1</h4>
    <p> 1. Create an array to use as your shopping list with 3 items: "Milk," "Bread," and
        "Apples."</p>
    <p>2. Check your list length in the console.</p>
    <p>3. Update "Bread" to "Bananas."</p>
    <p>4. Output your entire list to the console.</p>
    <h4>Exercise:3.2</h4>
    <p> 1. Create an empty array to use as a shopping list.</p>
    <p>2. Add Milk, Bread, and Apples to your list.</p>
    <p>3. Update "Bread" with Bananas and Eggs.</p>
    <p>4. Remove the last item from the array and output it into the console.</p>
    <p>5. Sort the list alphabetically.</p>
    <p>6. Find and output the index value of Milk.</p>
    <p>7. After Bananas, add Carrots and Lettuce.</p>
    <p>8. Create a new list containing Juice and Pop.</p>
    <p>9. Combine both lists, adding the new list twice to the end of the first list.</p>
    <p>10. Get the last index value of Pop and output it to the console.</p>

    <h4>Exercise:3.3</h4>
    <p>1. Create an array containing three values: 1, 2, and 3.</p>
    <p>2. Nest the original array into a new array three times.</p>
    <p>3. Output the value 2 from one of the arrays into the console.</p>
    <h4>Exercise:3.4</h4>
    <p>1. Create a new myCar object for a car. Add some properties, including, but not
    limited to, make and model, and values for a typical car or your car. Feel free
    to use booleans, strings, or numbers</p>
    <p>2. Create a variable that can hold the string value color. This variable
    containing a string value color can now be used to reference the property
    name within myCar. Then, use the variable within the square bracket notation
    to assign a new value to the color property in myCar.</p>
    <p>3. Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it, such as
    forSale. Use the bracket notation once again to assign a new value to the
    forSale property to indicate whether the car is available for purchase.</p>
    <p>4. Output make and model into the console.</p>
    <p>5. Output the value of forSale into the console.</p>
    <h4>Exercise:3.5</h4>
    <p>1. Create an object named people that contains an empty array that is called
    friends.</p>
    <p>2. Create three variables, each containing an object, that contain one of your
    friend's first names, last names, and an ID value.</p>
    <p>3. Add the three friends to the friend array.</p>
    <p>4. Output it to the console.</p>

    <h4>Exercise:4.1</h4>
    <p>1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.</p>
    <p>2. Output the value of the variable to the console.</p>
    <p>3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console
    using the following syntax:</p>
    <p>4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether
    the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the
    console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an
    ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement
    insteadâ€”experiment!</p>
    <p>5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.</p>
    <h4>Exercise:4.2</h4>
    <p>1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age</p>
    <p>2. Convert the response from the prompt to a number</p>
    <p>3. Declare a message variable that you will use to hold the console message for
    the user</p>
    <p>4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to
    confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol</p>
    <p>5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to
    confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol</p>
    <p> 6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if
    none are true</p>
    <p>7. Output the response message variable to the console</p>
    <h4>Exercise:4.3</h4>
    <p>1. Create a Boolean value for an ID variable</p>
    <p>2. Using a ternary operator, create a message variable that will check whether
    their ID is valid and either allow a person into a venue or not</p>
    <p>3. Output the response to the console</p>
    <h4>Exercise:4.4</h4>
    <p>As discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with JavaScript, the JavaScript function Math.
    random() will return a random number in the range of 0 to less than 1, including 0
    but not 1. You can then scale it to the desired range by multiplying the result and
    using Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number; for example, to
    generate a random number between 0 and 9:</p>
    <h4>Exercise:4.5</h4>
    <p>1. Create a variable called prize and use a prompt to ask the user to set the
    value by selecting a number between 0 and 10</p>
    <p>2. Convert the prompt response to a number data type</p>
    <p>3. Create a variable to use for the output message containing the value "My
    Selection</p>
    <p>4. Using the switch statement (and creativity), provide a response back
    regarding a prize that is awarded depending on what number is selected</p>
    <p>5. Use the switch break to add combined results for prizes</p>
    <p> 6. Output the message back to the user by concatenating your prize variable
    strings and the output message string</p>
